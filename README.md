# CS-300-SNHU


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    The problem I was trying to solve was to build a application for ABCU Computer Science department 
    that accesses course information for students using code developed using algorithms and data structures
    to solve basic programming problems. 
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    I approached the problem in sections based on requirements. Developed code in different data structures 
    and chose from the one that best made sense for this project based on the analysis. Data structure are important
    to understand because data structure are a major factor for storing data. With the inclusion of algorithms it 
    makes mangement of large amounts of data more efficient. 
    
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    I overcame roadblocks while going through the project by reaching out to my instructor and real time tutoring 
    for more clarification and help to solve coding issues and testing issues.  While working on this project I had 
    issues with the file opening that listed the course and their prerequisites. With help of the tutor he was able 
    to explain the issues and what exactly was the problems and suggested possible solutions. 
    
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    The work i completed in this project has allowed me to think more consciously about how programs store and organize
    data and to really pay attention to the aspects that could make or break a system based on the amounts of data being
    used and how to analize the best options for choosing the right method to do this. 
    
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    I believe that the work in this project helped me be more focused and has given me the experience to create a well 
    rounded application. It has allowed me to be more critical of my work and what I need to lok for when it comes to
    data structures.
